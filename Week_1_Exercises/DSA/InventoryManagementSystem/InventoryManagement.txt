1. Understand the Problem
Q.Why Data Structures and Algorithms Are Essential in Handling Large Inventories

=>1.Efficient Data Storage: Proper data structures ensure that inventory data is stored in a way that minimizes memory usage and supports quick access.
2.Fast Retrieval and Updates: Algorithms optimized for searching, inserting, and updating ensure that operations can be performed quickly, which is crucial for managing large inventories.
3.Scalability: Data structures that can handle growing amounts of data without significant performance degradation are essential.
4.Data Integrity and Consistency: Using appropriate data structures ensures that inventory data remains consistent and accurate, even with concurrent access and modifications.

Q.Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
=>Types of Data Structures Suitable for This Problem are:
1.ArrayList: Provides dynamic array capabilities, allowing for efficient random access and easy resizing.
2.HashMap: Offers constant time complexity for insertion, deletion, and look-up operations, making it ideal for inventory management.
3.TreeMap: Maintains sorted order of keys and allows for efficient range queries and ordered operations.

4. Analysis
Q.Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.
=>Time Complexity of Each Operation
1.Add Product: O(1) - Insertion in a HashMap is generally constant time.
2.Update Product: O(1) - Updating a value in a HashMap is also constant time.
3.Delete Product: O(1) - Removing an entry from a HashMap is constant time.

Q.Discuss how you can optimize these operations.
=>Optimizing Operations
1.Batch Processing: For bulk updates or inserts, consider batch processing to reduce the overhead of multiple individual operations.
2.Concurrency: Use concurrent data structures like ConcurrentHashMap if the inventory management system needs to handle simultaneous read/write operations by multiple threads.
3.Indexing: If search operations on non-key attributes (e.g., productName) become frequent, consider adding indexing mechanisms or secondary data structures to support faster lookups.
